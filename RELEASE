Release notes for GStreamer Base Plug-ins 0.11.2 "Drool Pool"
        


The GStreamer team is proud to announce a new release
in the 0.11.x unstable series of the
GStreamer Base Plug-ins.


The 0.11.x series is an unstable series targeted at developers and will
eventually lead up to the stable 1.0 series.
It is not API or ABI compatible with the stable 0.10.x series.
It is, however, parallel installable with the 0.10.x series.


This module contains a set of reference plugins, base classes for other
plugins, and helper libraries.

This module is kept up-to-date together with the core developments.  Element
writers should look at the elements in this module as a reference for
their development.

This module contains elements for, among others:

  device plugins: x(v)imagesink, alsa, cdparanoia
  containers: ogg
  codecs: vorbis, theora
  text: textoverlay, subparse
  sources: audiotestsrc, videotestsrc, giosrc
  network: tcp
  typefind functions
  audio processing: audioconvert, adder, audiorate, audioresample, volume
  visualisation: libvisual
  video processing: videoconvert
  aggregate elements: uridecodebin, playbin, decodebin, encodebin
  libraries: app, audio, cdda, fft, interfaces, pbutils, riff, rtp, rtsp, sdp, tag, video


Other modules containing plug-ins are:


gst-plugins-good
contains a set of well-supported plug-ins under our preferred license
gst-plugins-ugly
contains a set of well-supported plug-ins, but might pose problems for
    distributors
gst-plugins-bad
contains a set of less supported plug-ins that haven't passed the
    rigorous quality testing we expect
